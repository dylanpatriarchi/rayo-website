# Rayo Consulting Design System

## Philosophy
"Minimalism meets Organic High-Tech".
The design language combines rigorous geometric grids with fluid, organic forms to represent the duality of Code + Biology (AI).

## Color Palette
- **Background**: #030303 (Almost Black) - Deep, infinite canvas.
- **Foreground**: #FFFFFF (Pure White) - Sharp contrast for typography.
- **Primary**: #3B82F6 (Blue-500 equivalent) - Used sparingly for accents and interactive states.
- **Glass**: Multiple layers of white/10 with backdrop-blur for depth.

## Typography
- **Primary Font**: Helvetica Now Display.
- **Usage**:
    - Headings: Tight tracking, bold weights.
    - Body: Light weights (300/400), relaxed leading for readability.

## UI Patterns

### 1. Liquid Glass
Components often feature a `backdrop-blur` with a subtle white border and shadow, mimicking frosted glass or liquid surfaces.
Class: `bg-white/40 backdrop-blur-[40px] border border-white/60`.

### 2. ScrollStack
Vertical lists are presented not as grids but as stacking cards that overlap on scroll, creating a sense of depth and physical accumulation of value.

### 3. Interactive 3D
The HERO section features a WebGL liquid logo that responds to mouse movement, signaling that the digital environment is "alive".

### 4. Bento Grids
Used for feature lists or case studies to allow variable aspect ratios and visual hierarchy.

## Animations
- **GSAP**: Used for precise scroll-triggered entrances (text reveals, opacity fades).
- **Lenis**: Smooth scrolling is mandatory for the premium feel.
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover states on cards include scale, shadow, and border-color transitions.
